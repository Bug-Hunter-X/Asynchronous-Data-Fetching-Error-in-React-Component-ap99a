# Asynchronous Data Fetching Error in React Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving asynchronous data fetching.  The `MyComponent` attempts to render data from an API before the data has been fully fetched, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

## The Problem
The `useEffect` hook fetches data from an API. However, the component tries to render the `data` before the promise from `fetch` resolves.  This will cause either an error if the component tries to access properties of a `null` value, or unexpected behavior if the component doesn't correctly handle the `null` value.

## The Solution
The solution involves correctly handling the loading state and only rendering the data after it has been fetched successfully.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
